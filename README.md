# hellosimd

I had never used simd (single instruction multiple data) before, so I tried it out to familiarize myself.

This is the simplest possible use case I can imagine: adding 2 large vectors of floats to eachother.

You can confirm that using simd gets the same results in less time - and it's surprisingly easy to work with. That's really all I wanted to know, so this is already a wrap for me. I'm left wondering why I didn't learn this earlier, it seems like a cheat code.
